## MLflow Tracking

MLflow Tracking is a powerful tool for managing the machine learning lifecycle. It offers:

- **Logging Capabilities**: Record parameters, code versions, metrics, and artifacts throughout your ML process.
- **Centralized Repository**: Capture and store all relevant information about your models in one place.
- **Flexible Usage**: Works with various environments including scripts, notebooks, and more.
- **Easy Comparison**: Compare multiple runs across different users and experiments.
- **Versatile Storage**: Log results to local files or a centralized server.

With MLflow Tracking, you can easily monitor your models' performance, track experiments, and make data-driven decisions to improve your ML workflows.
